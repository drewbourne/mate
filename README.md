Mate, a tag-based event-driven Flex Framework. 

This is a forked version of [Mate](http://mate.asfusion.com/) that uses [SwitftSuspenders](https://github.com/tschneidereit/SwiftSuspenders) for instantiation and dependency injection. The intention is to provide a migration path for converting Mate applications to [RobotLegs](http://robotlegs.org).
